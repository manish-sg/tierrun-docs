# Build a generative AI SaaS with OpenAI, Vercel, Stripe, and Tier

With the advent of OpenAI and GPT-4, it's now easier than ever to build your own SaaS that generates content - whether that's marketing copy, tweets, or anything else.

But although **generation** of content is easy, productionizing your SaaS app can still be a pain.

This tutorial will guide you through building an end-to-end SaaS, including a full-stack web application with integrated payments and an easy-to-adapt template. You'll use online platforms Vercel and Stripe to do the heavy lifting so you can focus on building the unique parts of your own SaaS.

At the end of the guide, you’ll have a ready-to-go SaaS application that generates marketing copy for your customers, complete with customizable subscription plans.

We'll cover all the steps required to set up the most important pieces of the app at a high level and where appropriate link to the relevant docs for each of the components. We'll also show you how to change the pricing, content, frontend, and anything else you like to make the application your own.

## Setting up the template

The basic starter version of this template is [on GitHub](https://github.com/tierrun/tier-vercel-openai) and has all the necessary ingredients for your SaaS app: It uses Tier, OpenAI, Next.js (full stack JavaScript), Vercel (for hosting and database), and Stripe. 

The advantage of a stack like this is that it covers all the tech fundamentals you need to build and scale a SaaS business, the services it uses offer generous free tiers, and you can deploy your app without having to consult a DevOps engineer. 

Tier adds a layer on top of Stripe so that you can feature gate subscriptions and offer grandfather plans. OpenAI is the most advanced AI-based API provider in the world and their flagship ChatGPT is being used by students everywhere to cheat on their homework. Next.js and Vercel work together to provide the most seamless full-stack web application experience with a huge ecosystem of connectors, libraries, and packages for virtually any use case. Finally, Vercel Postgres is a relatively new service, but it's underpinned by the same Vercel serverless principles allowing you to scale your SQL database without having to manage infrastructure. 

Here are the basic steps to get started with the repository:

1. Install Git if not already installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the desired directory.
4. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/tierrun/tier-vercel-openai`.
5. Wait for the cloning process to complete.
6. Navigate into the cloned repository.
7. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`. 
8. If there is a `package.json` file, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
9. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

Now we can configure the services in our stack. 

## Authentication

NextAuth.js comes with templates for popular authentication providers. We will provide "Log in with Google" and "Log in with Github" options. The steps below are in brief, [see here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers/oauth) for more details.

## Adapting the template to your own needs

![Tier architecture](/images/tutorials/ai-generator-app/im6.png)

Tier provides an opinionated yet flexible way to implement pricing. It is designed to work from within your app and provide an abstraction layer on top of Stripe for anything related to pricing, billing, subscriptions, entitlements, metering, and so on. 

Normally as the business grows or pivots over time, the logic required to enable all these features can become quite unmanageable, burning up development hours on customer-side features. With Tier, all the elements of pricing operations are brought under one logical entity, giving you a single source of truth in `pricing.json` at any given time. When the pricing model shifts, the older customers retain access to the app based on their existing pricing plans while new customers are migrated to the new model in a way that reduces the code to handle metering, entitlements, and other aspects of subscription pricing. 

For the template, this is the starting point:

```json
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:free@0": {
      "title": "Free",
      "features": {
        "feature:aicopy": {
          "mode": "volume",
          "tiers": [
            {
              "upto": 1
            }
          ],
          "title": "AI Generated Copy"
        },
        "feature:base": {
          "base": 0,
          "title": "Base"
        }
      }
    },
    "plan:startup@0": {
      "title": "Startup",
      "features": {
        "feature:aicopy": {
          "mode": "volume",
          "tiers": [
            {
              "upto": 4
            }
          ],
          "title": "AI Generated Copy"
        },
        "feature:base": {
          "base": 2000,
          "title": "Base"
        },
        "feature:extraaicopy": {
          "title": "AI Generated Extra - Copy",
          "mode": "volume",
          "tiers": [
            {
              "price": 500
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "plan:business@0": {
      "title": "Business",
      "features": {
        "feature:aicopy": {
          "mode": "volume",
          "tiers": [
            {
              "upto": 10,
              "base": 0
            }
          ],
          "title": "AI Generated Copy"
        },
        "feature:base": {
          "base": 4000,
          "title": "Base"
        },
        "feature:extraaicopy": {
          "mode": "volume",
          "tiers": [
            {
              "price": 400
            }
          ],
          "title": "AI Generated Copy - Extra"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here we have three plans and three features, and each plan has a set of features associated with it. Now you can mix and match the plans and features to create a set that works for your use case. 

For example, to check a customer's access to a feature, the logic is reduced to a generalized code block that does not need to change as the plan or feature details are changed.

```jsx
const access = await tier.can(
  'org:customer-id-from-your-db',
  'feature:feature-from-base-plan'
)
if (access.ok) {
  // Give access to the feature here
} else {
  // Handle restriction and upselling here.
}
```

Similarly, for your billing portal, you may like to create a feature usage report. 

```jsx
await tier.report('org:customer-id-from-your-db',
	'feature:feature-id',
	 1 // This is the unit of feature consumption,
	{
		at: new Date('23 March 2023'),
		clobber: true // If you want the usage amount to override any previously reported usage of the feature for the current phase
	}
);
```

Note how different features have different models associated with them. You can handle this at a granular plan-level, giving you close control over the logic of subscription and entitlement without needing to create any ad hoc coding patterns as the application evolves. 

### Implementing different pricing models

You might want to begin charging your customers to use your app using a simple, single-tier, per-user model, for example, $10 per user per month.

This model is technically a usage-based price because it's based on how many seats are being used. However, unlike charging for disk space or requests, the counter is not reset each billing cycle.

We use `"aggregate":"perpetual"` to always charge a customer based on the most recent usage level, across all billing periods. This way, we only have to update their seat consumption when it changes.

```jsx
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:[email protected]": {
      "features": {
        "feature:seat": {
          "aggregate": "perpetual",
          "tiers": [
            { "price": 1000 }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Should you wish to add pricing models to accommodate countable actions, for example, based on the number of marketing copy documents generated, you could add flat-rate or tiered pricing options to `pricing.json`. Pricing options can then be versioned and grandfathered when plans are retired.

Flat pricing:

```jsx
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:[email protected]": {
      "features": {
        "feature:message": {
          "tiers": [
            {
              "price": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Tiered Pricing:

```jsx
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:[email protected]": {
      "features": {
        "feature:message": {
          "tiers": [
            {
              "upto": 1000,
              "base": 1000
            },
            {
              "price": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While we've shown you the steps to take to turn your SaaS content generator into a fully functional, production-ready application, this is just the beginning of your SaaS journey. Now you can take your application and turn it into your own and Tier will take care of your pricing needs like entitlements, subscriptions, metering, and grandfathering plans to ensure that your SaaS application is set to evolve as your business moves and the systems of record are always configured automatically.
